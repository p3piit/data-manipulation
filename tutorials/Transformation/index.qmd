Data transformation is the process of modifying variables to make them more useful for analysis. This can include changing variable types, creating new variables, combining existing ones, or standardizing values. Transformations help prepare data for modeling, simplify interpretation, and often make relationships in the data clearer.

In R, transformations can be performed using base functions or with tools from dplyr, which provide more concise and readable syntax.
