title: "Subsetting"
---

Every dataset in R can be thought of as a collection of elements—rows, columns, and individual values—that can be accessed, modified, or extracted as needed. Subsetting is the process of selecting specific portions of a data object, whether that means isolating one variable, extracting a set of rows, or filtering observations that meet particular conditions. It is a fundamental skill for working efficiently with data, as it allows you to focus your analysis on relevant subsets without altering the original dataset.

Subsetting is possible with nearly all object types in R, but it is especially important when working with data frames. It lets you target specific parts of a dataset using indices, names, or logical conditions. Understanding how to subset effectively provides the foundation for most data manipulation tasks in R.
