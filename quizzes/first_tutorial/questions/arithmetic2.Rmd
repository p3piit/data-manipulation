## Generate some data
x <- sample(1:5, 1)
y <- sample(1:5, 1)
z <- sample(1:5, 1)

## Calculate the answer
a <- (x + y) / z
```

Question
========
What is the value of $x$ in the following equation?

$$
x = \frac{`r x` + `r y`}{`r z`}
$$

Round your answer to two decimal places.

Solution
========
After rounding, we get `r fmt(a, digits = 2)`.
