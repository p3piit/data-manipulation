Question
========

Using `dplyr`, how would you select only female participants under 25 years old from the `bfi` dataset? (Multiple answers may be correct.)

Answerlist
----------
* `filter(bfi, gender == "female", age < 25)`
* `filter(bfi, gender == "female" & age < 25)`
* `filter(bfi, age < 25, gender == "female")`
* `select(bfi, gender == "female", age < 25)`
* `filter(bfi, gender = "female", age < 25)`
* `bfi[bfi$gender == "female" & bfi$age < 25, ]`
* `subset(bfi, gender == "female" & age < 25)`
* `filter(bfi, age > 25 & gender == "female")`
* `arrange(bfi, gender == "female" & age < 25)`
* `bfi[filter, gender == "female", age < 25]`

Solution

Answerlist
----------
* Correct. Both conditions are comma-separated, equivalent to “AND.”
* Correct. The `&` operator gives the same result as commas.
* Correct. The order of conditions does not matter.
* Incorrect. `select()` is used to choose columns, not filter rows.
* Incorrect. The single `=` is not valid for logical comparisons in R; use `==`.
* Incorrect. While this base R syntax works, it is not using `dplyr`.
* Incorrect. While this base R syntax works, it is not using `dplyr`.
* Incorrect. This filters for participants older than 25, not under 25.
* Incorrect. `arrange()` is used for sorting, not filtering.
* Incorrect. `filter` must be a function, not an index argument.
