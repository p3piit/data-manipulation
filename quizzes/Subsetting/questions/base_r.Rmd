Question
========
Which of this phrases regarding the operators `[]`, `[[]]`, and `$` when subsetting a data frame are true?

Answerlist
----------
* `[]` returns data frames, `[[]]` extracts single elements, and `$` extracts columns by name.
* `[]` can subset both rows and columns, while `$` works only for named columns.
* `[[]]` is typically used for lists and returns the object itself, not a sub-data frame.
* All three are identical and interchangeable.
* `$` can only be used for numeric indices.
* `[[]]` can return multiple columns at once.
* `[]` can only be used for lists, not for data frames.
* `[[]]` and `$` behave identically in all cases.
* Only `[]` supports logical conditions for subsetting.

Solution

Answerlist
----------
* Correct. This summarizes the real behavior of these three operators.
* Correct. This is a key distinction between these operators.
* Correct. `[[]]` is primarily for lists and returns the actual object.
* Incorrect. They differ in syntax, output type, and flexibility.
* Incorrect. `$` works only with column names, not numbers.
* Incorrect. `[[]]` extracts exactly one element at a time.
* Incorrect. `[]` works perfectly with data frames.
* Incorrect. They have different use cases and outputs.
* Incorrect. You can use logical conditions with both `[]` and `filter()` but not `$` or `[[]]`.
