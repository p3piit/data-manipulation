Question
========
Write a single line of base R code that returns a data frame containing only the rows of `bfi` where `age` is less than 50, `gender` is equal to 1, and `education` is not missing and greater than or equal to 4. The code must keep exactly the three columns `gender`, `age`, and `education` in that order. You must use only base R subsetting syntax.



Solution
========

The required R code is:
`bfi[age < 50 & gender == 1 & !is.na(education) & education >= 4, c("gender", "age", "education")]`
