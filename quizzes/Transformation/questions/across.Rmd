Question
========
Which of the following use `across()` correctly to compute row means for all items from `"A1"` to `"A5"` and store the result in a new variable `agree`?

Answerlist
----------
* `mutate(bfi, agree = rowMeans(across(A1:A5), na.rm = TRUE))`
* `bfi <- mutate(bfi, agree = rowMeans(across(A1:A5), na.rm = TRUE))`
* `mutate(bfi, agree = rowMeans(across(c(A1:A5)), na.rm = TRUE))`
* `mutate(bfi, agree = rowMeans(A1:A5, na.rm = TRUE))`
* `mutate(bfi, agree = across(A1:A5, rowMeans, na.rm = TRUE))`
* `mutate(bfi, agree = rowMeans(across(A1:A5))) |> head()`
* `bfi <- mutate(bfi, agree = across(A1:A5, rowMeans))`
* `mutate(bfi, agree = rowMeans(bfi[A1:A5], na.rm = TRUE))`

Solution
========

Answerlist
----------
* TRUE. This is the correct way to use `across()` to select columns `A1` to `A5` and compute their row means while handling `NA` values.
* TRUE. This correctly assigns the result of the row means calculation to the `bfi` data frame.
* TRUE. This is also a correct usage of `across()` to select the columns and compute row means with `NA` handling.
* FALSE. This does not use `across()` and will result in an error since `rowMeans` cannot directly take column ranges.
* FALSE. This is incorrect because `across()` is not designed to be used this way for row-wise operations.
* FALSE. This will not work as intended because `rowMeans` cannot directly take the result of `across()` without proper handling.
* FALSE. This is incorrect because `across()` cannot be used in this way to compute row means.
* FALSE. This does not use `across()` and will result in an error since `rowMeans` cannot directly take column ranges.
