Question
========
Which `dplyr` command creates a mean-centered version of age called `age_mc` in the data frame `bfi`?

Answerlist
----------
* `bfi <- mutate(bfi, age_mc = age - mean(age))`
* `bfi <- mutate(bfi, age_mc = age / mean(age))`
* `bfi <- mutate(bfi, age_mc = scale(age))`
* `bfi$age_mc <- scale(age)`
* `bfi <- mutate(bfi, age_mc = mean(age))`
* `bfi <- transform(bfi, age_mc = age - mean(bfi$age))`
* `mutate(age_mc = age - mean(age))`
* `bfi <- mutate(bfi, age = age - mean(age))`
* `bfi <- filter(bfi, age - mean(age))`
* `bfi <- mutate(age_mc <- age - mean(age))`


Solution
========

Answerlist
----------
* TRUE. This correctly creates a mean-centered version of age.
* FALSE. Divides by the mean, normalization, not centering.
* FALSE. `scale()` standardizes (centers and scales), not just centers.
* FALSE. `scale()` standardizes (centers and scales), not just centers.
* FALSE. This assigns the mean value to all entries, not centering.
* FALSE. Correct syntax but `mean(bfi$age)` is less common than `mean(age)` within `mutate()`.
* FALSE. Missing the data frame to mutate.
* FALSE. Overwrites `age` instead of creating `age_mc`.
* FALSE. `filter()` is for subsetting rows, not creating new variables.
* FALSE. Incorrect syntax for `mutate()`.
