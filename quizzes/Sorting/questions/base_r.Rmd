Question
========
Which command sorts the numeric vector `x` in descending order using only base R?

Answerlist
----------
* `sort(x, decreasing = TRUE)`
* `sort(x)`
* `order(x, decreasing = TRUE)`
* `x[sort(x)]`
* `sort(x, reverse = TRUE)`
* `arrange(x, desc())`
* `sort(-x)`
* `sort(x, decreasing = FALSE)`

Solution
========

Answerlist
----------
* TRUE. `sort(x, decreasing = TRUE)` correctly sorts `x` in descending order.
* FALSE. `sort(x)` sorts in ascending order by default.
* FALSE. `order(x, decreasing = TRUE)` returns the indices that would sort `x` in descending order, not the sorted vector itself.
* FALSE. `x[sort(x)]` does not sort `x` in descending order; it returns elements of `x` at the positions given by sorting `x`.
* FALSE. `sort(x, reverse = TRUE)` is not a valid argument in the `sort` function.
* FALSE. `arrange(x, desc())` is from the dplyr package, but more importantly, `arrange` is used for data frames, not vectors.
* FALSE. `sort(-x)` sorts the negated values of `x`, which does not yield the correct descending order of `x`.
* FALSE: `sort(x, decreasing = FALSE)` sorts in ascending order.
